# Claude Code Manager

> A self-hosted, GUI-based session manager for Claude Code with multi-device support

## Overview

Claude Code Manager brings the familiar Claude.ai interface to your local machine while adding powerful session management capabilities. Keep your conversation history, work on multiple projects simultaneously, and access everything from your Mac, iPhone, or any device on your network.

## Key Features

- **Persistent Sessions**: Never lose context again - all conversations saved locally
- **Git-Based Isolation**: Each session runs on its own Git branch for true isolation
- **Multi-Session Support**: Work on multiple projects concurrently
- **Self-Hosted**: Runs on your Mac, accessible from any device on your network
- **Claude.ai-Like Interface**: Familiar, polished UI you already know
- **Easy Settings Management**: Configure Claude Code through a clean UI

## Why Claude Code Manager?

### Problems We Solve

1. **Lost Context**: Terminal-based Claude Code loses history when you quit
2. **Single Session Limitation**: Can't easily switch between multiple projects
3. **Terminal UI**: Not everyone is comfortable with terminal interfaces
4. **Device Lock-In**: Can't check progress from your phone or tablet

### Our Solution

- Git branches for session isolation
- SQLite for persistent conversation storage
- Beautiful desktop app built with Tauri
- Optional web interface for multi-device access

## Architecture

```
Desktop App (Tauri)
       ↓
Backend Server (Node.js + TypeScript)
       ↓
Claude Agent SDK → Anthropic API
       ↓
SQLite + Git Repositories
```

**Tech Stack**:
- **Desktop**: Tauri 2.x (Rust + React)
- **Backend**: Node.js + TypeScript + Fastify
- **Integration**: Claude Agent SDK
- **Storage**: SQLite + Git
- **Testing**: Vitest + Playwright

## Quick Start

> **Note**: Project is in active development. This section will be updated as features are completed.

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/claude-code-manager.git
cd claude-code-manager

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

# Start development
pnpm dev
```

## Development

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+
- **pnpm** 8+
- **Rust** (for Tauri)
- **Git**

```

### Development Workflow

We follow a strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) process with phase gates:

```
1. Documentation First  → Write use-case and test-case docs
2. Tests First (TDD)    → Write failing tests
3. Implementation       → Make tests pass
4. Code Review          → Automated review
5. Quality Gates        → All tests must pass
6. Merge                → Only if everything passes
```

**Read [`GUIDELINES.md`](./GUIDELINES.md) for detailed workflow.**

### Slash Commands

When working in Claude Code:

- `/start-feature` - Begin new feature with TDD workflow
- `/review-ready` - Run all quality checks before merge
- `/session-guide` - Show development quick reference
- `/architecture` - Review system architecture

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run unit tests
pnpm test:unit

# Run E2E tests
pnpm test:e2e

# Check coverage
pnpm test:coverage

# Lint
pnpm lint
```

### Quality Requirements

- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Code coverage ≥ 80%
- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ Code review passed
- ✅ Documentation complete

## Git-Based Sessions

### How It Works

Each session creates an isolated Git branch:

```
main
 ├─ session/sess_abc123  (Session: "Add authentication")
 ├─ session/sess_def456  (Session: "Refactor API")
 └─ session/sess_ghi789  (Session: "Fix bug #123")
```

### Benefits

- **True Isolation**: File changes don't conflict between sessions
- **Version Control**: Built-in history per session
- **Easy Merging**: Standard Git merge workflow when done
- **Familiar**: Developers already understand branches

### Requirements

- Projects must use Git
- If not initialized, app will prompt to run `git init`

## Current Status & Roadmap

> **Latest**: Phase 1 Complete + Backend Enhancements ✅
> **Next**: Phase 2 - Desktop UI (Tauri)
> **Details**: See [PROGRESS.md](./PROGRESS.md) for comprehensive status

### ✅ Phase 1: Backend Core (COMPLETE)
- ✅ Project setup and monorepo configuration
- ✅ Backend API with session management (CRUD, switch)
- ✅ Git integration service (branches, status, checkout)
- ✅ Claude Code CLI integration (headless mode)
- ✅ Message persistence (SQLite)
- ✅ WebSocket streaming (real-time responses)
- ✅ REST API with validation (Fastify + Zod)
- ✅ **BONUS**: Git operations (merge, conflict detection, branch deletion)
- ✅ **BONUS**: Enhanced settings management (get all, delete)
- **Tests**: 232 passing, 5 skipped

### ⏳ Phase 2: Desktop UI Basics (NEXT)
- [ ] Tauri project setup (React + TypeScript)
- [ ] API client (REST + WebSocket)
- [ ] Session list component with state management
